# O-RAN RIC Platform Deployment Project

## Project Overview
This project deploys O-RAN Software Community's Near-RT RIC J Release with production-ready xApps optimized for Claude Code CLI workflows.

## Architecture Overview
- **Platform**: Near-RT RIC J Release (O-RAN SC v4.0)  
- **Deployment**: Local k3s cluster (3-node configuration recommended)
- **xApps**: Traffic Steering, KPIMON, QoE Predictor, RC, Federated Learning
- **Interfaces**: E2 (southbound to RAN), A1 (northbound to Non-RT RIC), O1 (management)

## Key Commands and Workflows

### Cluster Management
```bash
# Start k3s cluster
sudo k3s server --write-kubeconfig-mode 644 --disable traefik --disable servicelb

# Install Cilium CNI
helm install cilium cilium/cilium --namespace kube-system --set operator.replicas=1
```

### RIC Platform Deployment
```bash
# Add O-RAN SC Helm repository
helm repo add ric https://gerrit.o-ran-sc.org/r/ric-plt/ric-dep

# CLAUDE.md

## AI Patch Guardrails (for Claude Code)

You are Claude Code working on this repository.  
Your main responsibilities are:
- Help implement small, well-scoped changes.
- Respect existing architecture, tests, and maintainer feedback.
- Avoid over-engineering and premature abstraction.

**IMPORTANT: You MUST follow all rules in this section whenever you propose patches or edit files.**

---

### 0. General workflow

1. **Explore & understand before coding**
   - ALWAYS read the relevant files and existing tests first.
   - Summarize your understanding and planned changes before editing.
   - If anything is ambiguous, ask for clarification instead of guessing.

2. **Plan → Implement → Verify**
   - Make a short plan (“think hard”) before you start editing.
   - Keep changes minimal and focused on the requested task.
   - Always run the relevant tests or at least explain precisely how to run them.

3. **Respect project-local rules**
   - The rules below (imports, logging, Dockerfile, tests, etc.) come from real code review feedback.
   - Treat them as authoritative for this repository.

---

### 1. Function abstraction & structure

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT introduce premature abstractions.**

1. **No trivial wrapper functions**
   - If a function only:
     - has 1–2 lines, AND
     - just calls another function (e.g., `return compose_text_message(...)`),
     - and is used only 1–2 times,
   - THEN: DO NOT create a separate helper function for it.
   - Example: DO NOT create `create_error_message(lang_code: str)` that only wraps `compose_text_message(get_response(...))`.

2. **Rule of Three (YAGNI)**
   - 1st occurrence: write the code inline.
   - 2nd occurrence: copy-paste is acceptable.
   - 3rd occurrence: you MAY propose a helper.
   - 4th occurrence: you SHOULD refactor into a shared abstraction.
   - Any refactor MUST clearly improve readability and reduce real duplication, not just “cosmetic” wrapping.

3. **Handler vs implementation**
   - For public handlers, follow this pattern:
     - `handler()`:
       - Handles `try/except`.
       - Logs exceptions with `logger.exception(...)`.
       - Returns a standard error message.
     - `_handler_impl()`:
       - Contains business logic only.
   - DO NOT move complex business logic into the handler.

---

### 2. Python imports

**IMPORTANT: All imports MUST follow PEP 8 and be at module top-level.**

1. **Placement**
   - Place imports at the top of the file, after module comments/docstring.
   - DO NOT add imports inside functions or methods unless explicitly documented as an exception.

2. **Order**
   - Group imports as:
     1. Standard library
     2. Third-party libraries
     3. Local modules
   - Separate each group with a blank line.

3. **Example**

```python
# 1. Standard library
from typing import Dict, Optional

# 2. Third-party
from linebot.v3.messaging import TextMessage

# 3. Local modules
from src.modules.qna.constants import RESPONSE_DATA_PATH
from src.modules.utils import compose_text_message, get_response
```

---

### 3. Logging & error handling

1. **Use `logger.exception` in `except` blocks**
   - When catching unexpected errors in handlers, prefer:
     ```python
     except Exception as e:
         logger.exception(f"Error in qna_handler: {e}")
         return compose_text_message(
             get_response(RESPONSE_DATA_PATH, "error_message", lang_code)
         )
     ```
   - This captures the full stack trace at ERROR level.

2. **Separation of concerns**
   - Handlers:
     - Validate input.
     - Call `_impl`.
     - Catch and log unexpected errors.
   - `_impl` functions:
     - Contain business logic and can be unit-tested directly.

---

### 4. Dockerfile changes

**IMPORTANT: Keep runtime images slim and focused on runtime dependencies.**

1. **Base image**
   - Prefer minimal base images similar to:
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-bookworm-slim
     ```

2. **Dependency installation**
   - Copy only `pyproject.toml` and lockfiles before running the install command.
   - Install ONLY runtime dependencies inside the final image.
   - DO NOT install tools that are only required for:
     - type checking (e.g. pyright),
     - linters,
     - local development.
   - If such tools are needed, suggest:
     - a dev-only image, or
     - a separate `dev` target in the Dockerfile,
     - but DO NOT add them silently.

---

### 5. Code smell & refactoring

When you notice repetition:

1. **Do NOT refactor automatically just because you see repetition.**
   - First, check:
     - Is this “incidental” repetition (similar text but different semantics)?
     - Or “essential” repetition (same logic, same semantics)?

2. **Avoid shotgun surgery**
   - If a change requires modifying many different files and call sites for a small benefit, you are probably introducing a bad abstraction.
   - In that case:
     - Explain the tradeoffs.
     - Ask the user before proceeding with a large refactor.

---

### 6. Tests & TDD

**IMPORTANT: Tests must be meaningful, not just “green”.**

1. **Correct TDD order**
   - DO NOT follow:
     - “write tests → accept whatever output you get”.
   - Instead:
     - Read the existing implementation first.
     - Understand whether the feature is implemented or still TODO.
     - Design tests that match the intended behavior.
     - Then update implementation to satisfy those tests.

2. **Detect unimplemented features**
   - If you see any of the following:
     - `// TODO: implement this`
     - returning an **empty struct** (e.g., `Tracing: &SomeType{}`)
     - variables assigned but only used as `_ = variable`
     - golden files containing empty objects like `tracing: {}`
   - THEN:
     - Treat the feature as “NOT YET IMPLEMENTED”.
     - DO NOT write tests that pretend the feature is fully working.
     - Instead, you may:
       - Add clearly labeled placeholder tests, OR
       - Create a GitHub issue describing the missing implementation.

3. **Test naming**
   - Use precise names:
     - `valid-X` → tests the successful path.
     - `invalid-X` → tests error handling and validation failures.
     - `placeholder-X` → feature not yet fully implemented, placeholder coverage only.
   - DO NOT name a test `invalid-tracing` if it does not actually test invalid behavior.

4. **No skipped tests in new code**
   - DO NOT add tests with `t.Skip()` unless explicitly requested and clearly documented as a temporary measure.
   - All new tests you add SHOULD run and pass on CI.

5. **Avoid redundant tests**
   - Before adding a new test file:
     - Check existing E2E / integration tests.
     - If existing tests already cover the behavior, DO NOT add redundant tests.
   - Example: For minimal RBAC changes, prefer relying on existing E2E tests rather than adding new tests that just verify Kubernetes basics.

6. **Use standard library & project helpers**
   - In Go tests:
     - Prefer `strings.Contains` over custom substring checks.
     - Use existing helper packages (e.g. `ktesting/setup.go`) instead of building ad-hoc loggers or setups.

---

### 7. File selection & change scope

**IMPORTANT: Keep diffs minimal and focused.**

1. **Verify file usage before editing**
   - Before modifying a file:
     - Check if it is still used in the build/runtime.
     - For suspicious files (e.g., old generators like `kubebuilder-gen.go`):
       - Use `git grep` or build commands to confirm usage.
   - If a maintainer comment says “this file is not used anymore, better to delete it”:
     - DO NOT update the file.
     - Suggest deleting it instead, if appropriate for this PR.

2. **Minimal patch principle**
   - For tasks like “minimal RBAC fix”:
     - Focus only on the specific RBAC manifests mentioned by the issue or reviewer.
     - Avoid:
       - editing unrelated manifests,
       - adding new test suites,
       - touching generator files unless required.

3. **Respect project conventions**
   - Follow existing patterns in the codebase:
     - Same logging style.
     - Same error handling style.
     - Same file layout and naming conventions.

---

### 8. Human review & maintainer feedback

1. **Maintainer comments are authoritative**
   - When a reviewer (e.g. project maintainer) gives feedback like:
     - “These tests are unnecessary.”
     - “This file is unused; delete it instead of updating it.”
   - You MUST:
     - Treat this feedback as the source of truth for future edits.
     - Reflect these rules in your subsequent patches.

2. **Document learnings**
   - When you discover a new project-specific rule through review:
     - Propose an update to `CLAUDE.md` (or ask the user to add it).
     - Follow the updated rule consistently in future changes.

---

### 9. How to work with tests & golden files in this repo

1. **Golden files**
   - When adding or updating golden files (YAML, JSON, etc.):
     - Ensure they contain meaningful, non-empty configuration.
     - If the implementation is a placeholder, clearly mark the golden file as such with comments.
     - Question suspicious emptiness (e.g., `tracing: {}`) and check whether the feature is really implemented.

2. **Creating follow-up issues**
   - If you identify missing behavior (e.g., tracing translation not fully implemented):
     - Propose creating a GitHub issue with:
       - Title, e.g.: `"Implement tracing translation in AgentgatewayPolicy frontend"`.
       - Links to the relevant PR / tests / files.
       - A plan for implementation and test updates.

---

### 10. Claude Code behavior summary (TL;DR)

When generating patches in this repo, you MUST:

- **Understand before coding**: read implementation & tests first.
- **Keep changes minimal**: avoid editing unused files or adding redundant tests.
- **Avoid premature abstraction**: no one-line wrappers unless used ≥3 times AND more readable.
- **Follow local style**: imports at top, logging via `logger.exception`, handler + `_impl` split, slim Dockerfiles.
- **Design meaningful tests**: no fake “invalid” tests, no `t.Skip()` tests, no empty golden files unless clearly marked as placeholders.
- **Respect maintainers**: treat review comments as project rules and adjust your behavior accordingly.

If you are unsure which rule applies, you MUST stop, summarize the options, and ask the user for guidance before making large-scale or irreversible changes.
